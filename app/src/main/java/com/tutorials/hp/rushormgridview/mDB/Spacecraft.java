/**
 - Our model class.
 - Our data object.
 - Take note it derives from co.uk.rushorm.core.RushObject.
 - This makes it a special object that can be saved,retrieved,edited or deleted to and from sqlite database.
 - It will be compiled to a sqlite database table.
 - The instance fields will be mapped to database table rows.
 - However, apart from deriving from RushObject, it must also define an empty constructor. If you have to pass other things via constructor then define a separate constructor for those.
 - NB/= The package for the model class should be specified in AndroidManifest.xml. Have a look at the manifest to see how we defined.
 This is beacuse RushORM needs to know where to find the class that should be converted to a table.
